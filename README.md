#
## Explain
Sending the POST request to http://localhost:8000/api/payment-checkout/cafe24 or http://localhost:8000/api/payment-checkout/shopify (the requests are already provided in the POSTMAN json file above)

**Require 1**: Receive Checkout requests from the e-Commerce platforms: Shopify and Cafe24.

For future scenarios, simply implement a new service for the new platform like `ShopifyService` class or `Cafe24Service` class extending `AbstractMerchantService` and add it to Factory class

**Require 2**: Validate Checkout request.

The request body is then is being validated in `PaymentCheckoutRequest`

The signature is being verified in method `verifyCheckoutRequest`

**Require 3**: Save requests to the database.

The request is then saved to `payment_requests` table using `saveRequest` method

**Require 4**: Prepare parameters for Checkout API call (for step 3).

Implemented in `prepareParamsForCheckoutRequest` method

**Require 5**: Send request to Checkout API to get Checkout URL (step 3).

Implemented in `getCheckoutUrl` method of `PaymentProviderService` class

This service will call a fake api and check for checkout_url in the response

**Require 6**: Return Checkout URL to platform

Return the checkout_url in json format

**Require 7**: Prevent duplicate Checkout requests:

Implemented in `getAndUpdateCheckoutUrl` method.

It's going to check for existing `checkout_url` in the record. If it's already existed, the request is already finished before, simply return the result back to user.
